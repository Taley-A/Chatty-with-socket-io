# Welcome to Chatty üó®Ô∏è!

## It is a chat messenging system made with Socket.io

Here is the documentation I used for Socket.io: https://socket.io/docs/v4/

### Socket.io enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.

Chatty allows real-time transmission of text messages from different users within the application!
